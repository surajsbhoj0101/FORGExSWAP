# 🔁 ForgeXSwap

**ForgeXSwap** is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Sepolia Testnet, powered by the core logic of **Uniswap V2's Automated Market Maker (AMM)** protocol. It is designed as a modern and developer-friendly DeFi platform that enables users to create tokens, provide liquidity, and swap assets — all through secure, permissionless smart contracts. ForgeXSwap serves as both a real-world functional dApp and a learning environment for understanding how decentralized exchanges work under the hood.

At its heart, ForgeXSwap provides complete on-chain functionality for:

- 🪙 **ERC20 Token Creation**: Deploy your own fungible tokens with customizable parameters directly from the UI.
- 💧 **Liquidity Provisioning**: Add and remove liquidity for any token pair, earn swap fees, and view your pool share.
- 🔄 **Token Swapping**: Instantly swap between any available ERC20 token pairs using a router that mirrors Uniswap V2’s logic.
- 📈 **Live Charting and Trade Metrics**: Visualize price movements, token ratios, and slippage with real-time ApexCharts-based data presentation.

ForgeXSwap was built with a clean, responsive frontend using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **ApexCharts** for visual analytics. Wallet connectivity and smart contract interactions are handled by a powerful stack including **Wagmi**, **RainbowKit**, and **Ethers.js**, ensuring seamless integration between users and the Ethereum blockchain.

This project isn’t just a DEX — it's a demonstration of how powerful and modular Web3 applications can be. Whether you're a user who wants to test liquidity strategies on a safe testnet environment or a developer looking to dive deep into DeFi protocols, **ForgeXSwap** offers a fully transparent and extensible platform to experiment with decentralized finance.
